- **CQRS Pattern** : Adopts the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern for separating read and write operations, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
- **Mediator Pattern** : Uses the Mediator pattern for simplifying communication between the presentation layer and the application layer, enhancing decoupling and testability.
- **Mapster** : Leverages Mapster for streamlined object mapping, enhancing efficiency and reducing boilerplate code.
